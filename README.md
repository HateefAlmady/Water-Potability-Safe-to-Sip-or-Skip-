# 🌊 Water Potability: Safe to Sip or Skip?

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the potability of water based on various water quality features using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to determine whether water is safe for consumption (sip) or potentially harmful (skip), utilizing a dataset of water quality characteristics. The project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning classification models to make accurate predictions on water potability.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict water potability based on a variety of water quality indicators, such as pH level, turbidity, and other chemical and physical properties. The model helps in identifying safe drinking water, which is essential for public health and safety.
